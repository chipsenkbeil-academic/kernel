Basic Kernel Project
====================
A basic kernel designed to learn how it works.

This is directly following Jame Molloy's 
[tutorial](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/).

Because the tutorial uses an old version of Bochs, my code will be updated
to reflect the new version. This includes changes to the Bochs configuration
and the Makefile, which was set to assume a 32-bit architecture.

Ideally, I will have a makefile that can take multiple architectures to
build the kernel for different platforms; however, I will be learning on my
`x86_64` system for now.

Tools Used
----------
* NASM  v2.10.09
* GRUB  v???
* BOCHS v2.6.2-1
